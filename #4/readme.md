#Face Recognition #4

 - created a logic allowing to answer True, but also False without going to the end of the video
 - checked for mismatch: for one video, run on all other video in the dataset
 - computed FAR e TAR statistichs, including ROC curve and their distribution 
 - check the type of errors we get (age difference, glasses, beard, etc...) and sort them by categories so that we can analyse them.
