DLIB configuration for NVidias gpus on Anaconda for Win10:
1. pip install Cmake
2. Download Cuda Environment (version 10) for Win10
3. Subscribe to Cuda Developer and download CuDNN
4. Put the files .dll found in the .zip in the right place inside the Cuda Environment installation
5. python setup.py install --set DLIB_USE_CUDA=1 --set USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=1

If every is correct it will appear: Dlib WILL USE CUDA


However there could be some incompatibility between your GPU driver and CUDA environemnt.

To solve it:
- I upgraded GPU drivers
- I downgraded CUDA environment

The version 10.1 cuda environment seems to be incompatible with my computer. while my gpu driver version is at maximum 423, the version 10.2 needs a driver at version higher than 440

-----------------------
I spent lots of hours trying to make the GPU work with DLIB.
At the end, after installing nvidia drivers and cuDNN drivers, I managed to install GPU computed DLIB.
However, although everything seems to be ok, I found some new errors.

Running the python notebook there was an issue about an incompatibility between my cuda driver and environment. 
So I updated my cuda driver to the latest available for graphic card. 
But looking on the Nvidia spec here: 
https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html#binary-compatibility__table-toolkit-driver
I could see that the latest driver was not enough updated to run on environment 10.2.
So I tried to downgrade the environment to 10.1. Installing it, the installation is blocked by some unspecified errors.
Versions <10.0 are totally incompatible for my system, as the installation program says.
At the end, with my graphic card, it worked using the environment 10.0.

I explored also Linux solution but it seems to that Virtual Machine has not a direct access to graphic card.
